NFT Auction DAPP

DAPP for Auctioning NFTs
Auction workflow:
1. Creator identifies NFT(s) for the Auction
2. Creator identifies start and end time.
3. Auction starts.
4. After endtime, highest bid receives NFT, and lower bids are returned.

user workflow:
1. user submits a bid for the auction
2. If user's bid is lower than another bid, lower bids are returned when higher bid is accepted.

What to do about transaction fees if we want to avoid transaction fees from mutiple bids ... create a payment channel for bidding?
